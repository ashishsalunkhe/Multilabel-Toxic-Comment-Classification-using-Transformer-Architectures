I suppose that the argument developed here means that no other resolution of the UN demanded the departure of Saddam Hussein, and that as such, the ultimatum made by the USA was not in a continuation of the UN process.

The US has a veto on the findings of fact. The behavior of other members on the security council demonstrate they feel no obligation to be intellectually honest in the evaluation of the facts. The US of course would have had to have done much more to prevent the cheating on the sanctions by several of the parties that voted for them.  How could the law passed by congress, be in anyway a violation of those provisions of the sanctions, it seems quite within them.

      " * Although several people discovered the mechanism whereby vector gauge bosons can acquire mass, Brout and Englert being the first to publish a relativistic demonstration, only Higgs drew attention to the consequential existence of a massive scalar particle, which now bears his name. \n",
      "\n",
      " * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had \"\"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details.\"\" His former mentor Walter Gilbert was lecturing at a summer school at Lake Como, so Guralnik made a special trip to tell him what they had achieved.... At the very time when Guralnik was talking with Gilbert, Higgs’s paper was already in production. This would become apparent only later... \n",
      "\n",
      " * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were \"\"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs.\"\" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  \n",
      "\n",
      " * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble’s work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... \n",
      "\n",
      " * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. \n",
      "\n",
      " * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgs’s manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englert’s paper was published. When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: \"\"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?\"\" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and \"\"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work.\"\" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. \n",
      "\n",
      " * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. \n",
      "\n",
      " * Tom Kibble recalled: \"\"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory.\"\" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, \"\"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didn’t know about Glashow’s work [on the SU2 × U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all.\"\" \n",

What I am saying, however, is that something as simple as infobox inclusions should be consensual and fair. That appears to be what everyone is not in consensus with. I don't see why we're confusing readers by making it seem as though the election is currently between four parties. Technically, it's between many parties. Four (or really, five) have the gained the ability to be on ballots that would accumulate 270 electoral votes. Two dominate the race. If and when the latter changes (which would be caused by media coverage, by the way, as very real as ballot access) we should reflect that. Currently, we're fooling people due to bureaucracy (at a superficial level, at least). My comments about the 2000 election were an example of possible overcoverage. Had that been on ongoing eletion, like this one, you would likely be supporting their negligable entries in the infobox. I never meant to appear disrespectful or ignorant, but we must take more into account than ballot access for representative coverage. '''''' \"\n",

It was also during the early stages of the Cold War, where there was fear of an actual thermonuclear war, hence the wish to know the full impact of radiological contamination of humans, to predict civilian and military casualties.

Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made and is the best such source for that context. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article, and should be appropriate to the claims made. If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it...   \n",
      " :::Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.

Meanwhile, we can't turn up even a single source of someone actually making the claim \"\"hyhens and dashes are the same\"\". Again, I ask the question: if this misconception is so common, why are there no examples of it? That's truly puzzling, don't you think?

I think you are referring to a baronet stub. Obviously we differ. In Britain a Baronet is a minor notable in his own right because he holds that title, either directly or hereditarily, from the monarch.

The debate extended outward from academia and became a subject of national conversation because it related directly to larger concerns such as race, identity, and academic freedom. The debate spawned dozens of books, scholarly articles, and conferences and was consistently reported on in the press. A simple search of just the phrase \"\"Black Athena\"\" on JSTOR finds 642 scholarly articles published since 1987 when the book came out. The debate is, in fact, still ongoing. Lefkowitz published her book History Lesson: A Race Odyssey in 2008 and Bernal published Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization: The Linguistic Evidence, Vol. 3 in 2006. This in spite of the fact that both Lefkowitz and Martin are now retired from Wellesley and teaching entirely.

And I didn't just 'overturn' concensus, but I actually took into consideration the RSN about this which said that trees themselves are not reliable, but the primary documents themselves are useful. This should not be hard concept to grasp, but in the discussion was geared towards 'primary documents' being OK (as under RS and other primary document criteria) and the 'family trees' made by amateurs are not reliable. All of the 'External links' were just a 'family tree', of which did not even cover Richard Tylman himself, but the presumed son and grandson as well. Poetic does not even have assess to the sources that he added, so even if we were to go for the better PRIMARY documents, the problem is that there is clear errors in the forms used and the best one represents a single line entry in a log book, and nothing more. Even the best source we have makes no mention about Richard Tylman being the mayor, and much of the prose here is wrong in its assertions. I'm not 'edit warring' and I haven't gone and addressed the OTHER issues because I don't want to deal with this every day I'm on wiki. And there actually SEEMS to be concensus about the links themselves not being reliable, which logically defaults to not being valid sources. Clemrutter even acknowledges this point as above. One of the 'includes' was a Sockpuppet and is invalid, yet it had no arguement either. The other was on the 'let readers decide if it is authoritive'.  \n",
      " :: If you want a proper gauge of the discussion, see the RSN entry as I noted. Its more obvious and detailed. Also the only two people who really made arguments were TFD and Poetic, both were active on the RSN debate as well. The fact three individuals on this RFC (which took place at the same time as the RSN debate) also have expressed concerns about the validity of the sources really defaults to the 3 Removes and 1 Yes (Poetic). A close with no concensus still equals removal. Either way, it doesn't change the result and no one on ANI or in the side discusses has dealt with the issues themselves, instead of the action of the close. Those who have expressed concerns with the sources did so in policy and knew that there really was no way they would have remained valid. Its because they do not pass RS, V and ELNO, not because I'm being a jerk. I could have closed it as 'no concensus' and still removed the things as according to policy. Instead I gave a solid answer on why TFD's argument won out in light of policy. Either way, if I closed as 'no concensus, removing links per policy' the outcome would have been no different to worse. Ironic thing, I don't even know why the previous incarnation of the poet Richard Tylman was deleted. It seems stupid to me and I have half a mind to try and resurrect the page, but Poetic is absent for now and I won't risk further ire by doing so. I'm not a 'bad guy', and I'm really level headed.

      ":This has come up several times in the past. This is the background to how it was raised. Bit bored by the topic now and desperately want to focus my wiki time on page creation (see List of Anglo-Saxon saints), but basically there is a tension between the forms you might expect from a superficial reading of UE guidelines, and those used by the reliable sources. Typically those who write articles in the era prefer the latter, while those brought in from process talk pages (like UE) prefer the former. No consensus on the matter has ever come about. Article titles are one thing. Different display titles are useful in different contexts. In monarch lists and more popular pages the anglicized names can be used without much difficulty; however using them in articles like this means departing from the forms used the in WP:RSs used to construct the article (as I can attest as the author) and creating serious issues of cognitive dissonance; compare this to using Gdansk in some eras but Danzig in others. We happened to have modern Anglicized names for Mael Coluim and a few famous kings, but most of the Scottish names used are ones like Garnait, Gille Chlerig and so where there is either no Anglicization or where it is so obscure as to be unhelpful. One of the routine experiences of reading about foreign societies in the distant past are unfamiliar name forms. One masters these and grows (and in any case, only a small minority of these names can ever be anglicized), and in any case I don't seriously believe the claim that 'general reader' will actually be confused. Even GoodDay was able to identify who Mael Coluim IV was.  ()\n",

      " The English language is a West Germanic language that originated in England from Old English (Anglo-Saxon), which in turn developed from languages brought by settlers from areas in modern-northern Germany and Denmark. It is the second most common first language, with around 340 million native speakers worldwide. English has lingua franca (diplomatic language) status in many parts of the world, due to the military, economic, scientific, political and cultural influence of the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries and the United States beginning in the 20th century. It is the most widely learned second language, due largely to the former extent of the British Empire in the 19th and early 20th century and to the enormous influence the United States has exerted through radio, television, cinema, scientific publications and the Internet in recent decades. \n",
      "\n",
      " History \n",
      "\n",
      " English is descended from languages spoken by Germanic tribes that migrated from what is now northern Germany and perhaps Denmark to what is now England. These tribes are traditionally identified as the Frisians, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, around the year 449, Vortigern, King of the British Isles, issued an invitation to the \"\"Angle kin\"\" (Angles, led by Hengest and Horsa) to help him against the Picts. In return, the Angles were granted lands in the South-East. Further aid was sought, and in response \"\"came men of Ald Seaxum of Anglum of Iotum\"\" (Saxons, Angles, and Jutes). The Chronicle talks of a subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms. Modern scholarship considers most of this story to be legendary and politically motivated. \n",
      " These Germanic invaders dominated the original Celtic-speaking inhabitants, whose languages survived largely in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland. The dialects spoken by these invaders formed what would be called Old English, which was a very similar language to modern Frisian. Later, it was also strongly influenced by the North Germanic language Old Norse, spoken by Norse who settled mainly in the North-East (see Jorvik). English, England, and East Anglia are derived from words referring to the Angles: Englisc, Angelcynn, and Engleland. \n",
      " For the 300 years following the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Kings of England spoke only French, using it as the Court language. A large number of French words were assimilated into Old English, some words doubling with Saxon words (for instance ox and beef, sheep and mutton). The Old English also lost most of its inflections, resulting in Middle English. Around the year 1500, the Great Vowel Shift transformed Middle English to Modern English. The most famous surviving works from Old and Middle English are Beowulf and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, respectively. \n",

The closest living relative of English is Scots (Lallans), a West Germanic language spoken mostly in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Like English, Scots is a direct descendant of Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon. \n",
      " After Scots, the next closest relatives are Frisian - spoken in the Netherlands and Germany - and modern Low Saxon language, spoken primarily in northern Germany. Other less closely related living languages include Dutch, Afrikaans, German and the Scandinavian languages. Many French words are also intelligible to an English speaker (pronunciations are not always identical, of course), as English absorbed a tremendous amount of vocabulary from the Norman language after the Norman conquest and from French in further centuries; as a result, a substantial share of English vocabulary is quite close to the French, with some minor spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.), as well as occasional differences in meaning. \n",

There have also been a few Mormon users on this site who have found it offensive.

Is it really necessary to keep reverting it to \"\"fuck\"\"?  I'm not offended by the word, and I'm sure many others are not...

This sentence is technically true as written, but could probably be made more NPOV by changing the phrase \"\"abortion rights\"\" to \"\"abortion\"\", like so: He opposes the role of women in preaching roles, opposes abortion, and believes that homosexuality is a sin.  Reasoning:  The use of the phrase \"\"abortion rights\"\" of necessity implies a right to abortion, and demonizes Mohler by casting him in the role of opposing a fundamental human right.  While it can most certainly be argued this is true, Mohler's own argument (and that of the entire pro-life movement) is that abortion is not a fundamental human right, it is murder.

Let me take a totally different subject, such as wound infections with \"\"flesh-eating bacteria\"\" (generally strains of Streptococcus pyogenes).
